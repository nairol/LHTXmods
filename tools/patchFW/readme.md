Just a little tool to patch the original firmware file.

Haven't put much effort into it. If someone wants to rewrite it in C, go for it.

`patchFW <SourceBinaryFile> <PatchFile> <DestinationBinaryFile>`

PatchFile must be in Verilog Memory List format, which is a very simple ASCII based hexdump format.
