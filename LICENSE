Please note that this repository also contains files that might not be subject
to this license. Specifically the NXP USBD example code may only be used on NXP
hardware. Watch out for license notes in the header of the files.

The resulting binary firmware files are also not subject to this license since
they consist of predominantly Valve's code with minor changes and additions.
