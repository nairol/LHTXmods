0. This is an unofficial firmware mod for HTC Vive Base Stations.
   Don't use it with anything else.
   This firmware enables the USB port and allows using the integrated shell that is usually only reachable via UART.

1. Unplug the power cable from the base station.

2. Find a Micro-USB cable that fits into the port on the back of the base station and plug it in.
   The other end goes into your PC.

3. Press and hold the mode selection button while plugging the power plug back in.
   The button is on the back of the box next to the connectors.

4. Your PC should detect a new flash drive called "CRP DISABLD".
   The base station should stay dark and silent.
   If it doesn't, unplug the power and try step 3 again.

5. Open the flash drive ("CRP DISABLD") with a file manager.
   There should be just one file called "firmware.bin".

6. Delete the file "firmware.bin".

7. Copy the new firmware file onto the flash drive.
   You don't need to change its name back to "firmware.bin".

8. Unplug the power cable and plug it back in.

9. Your operating system should detect the base station as virtual serial port.
   Use your favorite terminal application to connect to it.
   The connection settings don't matter but flow control should be disabled.
   (E.g. 115200 baud, 8 data bits, 1 stop bit, no parity, no flow control)


Make a backup of the factory calibration and configuration using the command:
> eeprom r 0 4032
Copy its output somewhere safe so that you can restore the base station in case something goes wrong.

Usually though the backup is not needed since you can revert all settings back to factory defaults using the command:
> factory load-cal

Stay away from the other commands starting with "factory" or "eeprom" if you don't know what you are doing.

Pressing the Tab key will show all available commands.

A list of all configuration parameters can be shown with:
> param list

Other useful commands are:
> param info <name>
> param get <name>
> param set <name> <value>
